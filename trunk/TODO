- good XHTL/CSS on mozilla/konqueror/safar/ie

= danlann 1.1.0 plan =

- cleanup function
- dry run function (no changes made to any files, show what would be done)
  
  for above stuff we need a python generator, which will yield files to be
  created; there should be consumers of this generator like:
  - cleanup
  - generate
  - dry run? <- maybe this should an option for generate?
